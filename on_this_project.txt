useful to not have to modify the package it self

Problem encountered :
    -> Transfrom the original (512,256,3) pictures to the image and mask pictures 
    with images being (256,256,3) and mask (256,256,13) # number of class = 13
    -> Hard to transform the first mask of (256,256,3) to (256,256,13), especially since the pixel didn't had the same value
    -> Had to resort to bins which resolved the issue
